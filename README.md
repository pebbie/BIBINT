bibliographical intelligence on semantic web platform.

This is a competitive intelligence tools for scientific literature.
The goal is to make a platform for mapping topic of interest and authors, 
making analytics of the domain, and decision support for researchers in order
to be successful in the field of interest.

research roadmap:
- linking data from digital libraries (DBLP, ieeexplore, ACM portal, citeseerX, Crossref, springer, etc)
- semantic annotation (using common ontologies and deep ontologies like SPAR vocabularies http://purl.org/spar)
- social network and spatio(knowledge area)-temporal analytics (dynamics modeling)
- structured prediction and risk analysis (what would be the next paper in area X? who will possibly write it? how is competition atmosphere?)
- complex system modeling using territorial model in evolutionary game theory

ambitious? yes
impossible? we don't know yet

Warning:
-----------
use with caution, it's still messy in here
